Given your desire to minimize backend server infrastructure and create a distributed web app for this multiplayer game, here's an architectural recommendation:
Architecture Design
1. Peer-to-Peer Communication:
Use WebRTC for peer-to-peer (P2P) communication. This minimizes server-side interaction for message passing and leverages the browsers to directly communicate between players.
A signaling server is required initially to establish the P2P connection but can be very lightweight.
2. Frontend-First Application:
Build the app as a Progressive Web App (PWA) with frameworks like React, Svelte, or plain JavaScript/TypeScript. This ensures the game can run mostly in the user's browser.
3. State Synchronization:
Use a distributed state synchronization library like Y.js or Automerge to keep game state consistent across players without requiring a central backend.
4. Temporary Backend Requirements:
For generating and sharing the unique game code, youâ€™ll need a simple signaling server. A lightweight server with WebSocket support can do this, e.g., a Node.js server or a Firebase Realtime Database.
5. Data Storage:
Since the game state is ephemeral and only needs to exist during gameplay, keep everything in memory on clients (via WebRTC and distributed state libraries).
6. User Workflow:
Step 1: Player 1 creates a game, triggering a request to the signaling server to generate a unique code. This code is shared with others.
Step 2: Other players join by entering the code, which establishes WebRTC connections and synchronizes their state using the distributed library.
Step 3: The game progresses round by round, with the distributed state library synchronizing the current player's turn and actions across peers.
Minimal Backend Implementation
Signaling Server:
Handles initial WebRTC connection setup (exchange of session descriptions and ICE candidates).
Could be implemented with a small WebSocket-based server or a serverless platform (e.g., AWS API Gateway + Lambda, Firebase Functions).
Technology Stack
Frontend:
Framework: React, Vue, or Svelte.
WebRTC for P2P connections.
Distributed state library: Y.js or Automerge.
Backend:
Lightweight WebSocket signaling server (e.g., Node.js with ws or socket.io).
Serverless alternatives: Firebase Realtime Database, AWS AppSync.
Challenges and Considerations
1. Browser Compatibility:
WebRTC works well on modern browsers but may require fallbacks for older ones.
2. Latency and Connectivity:
P2P networks can experience issues if players are behind strict NATs. Consider a TURN server for fallback in extreme cases.
3. Data Consistency:
Use a robust conflict-resolution mechanism in your distributed state library to handle simultaneous updates.
4. Scalability:
The backend signaling server is minimal and lightweight but might need scaling if the game becomes very popular.
Implementation Steps
1. Frontend:
Build a simple interface with options to create and join games.
Integrate WebRTC for establishing connections.
Use a distributed state library to synchronize game state.
2. Backend:
Build a lightweight signaling server to facilitate WebRTC connections.
Optionally add analytics, logging, or minor game validation here.
3. Testing:
Test connectivity, latency, and synchronization with multiple devices in various network conditions.
This approach minimizes backend dependencies, keeps most of the logic client-side, and scales well for lightweight games.
